# Flow-AI
This is the Flow Puzzle AI project developed by Victor Liu during an internship at the University of Nevada Reno in 2023. 
Flow AI.py is a fully functioning program that solves classic 5x5 puzzles from Flow using reinforcement learning. Use "clientMode" to toggle between client mode and programmer/debugger mode.
Flow AI Pathfinder.py is a supplemental program that was used to optimize the path-finding algorithm implemented in Flow AI.py. It may be run to demonstrate how a path from A to B is found. 
All other files are media images/videos demonstrating the functionalities of the program. 

The purpose of this internship and program was to spend the summer before college proactively learning about a new area of interest. 
Given the lack of prior experience, the codebase was written with only basic introductory coding knowledge. While functional, the code is not fully optimized or clean.
