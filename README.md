# Flow-AI
This is the Flow Puzzle AI project developed by Victor Liu during an internship at the University of Nevada Reno in 2023. 
Flow AI.py is a fully functioning program that solves classic 5x5 puzzles from Flow using reinforcement learning. Use "clientMode" to toggle between client mode and programmer/debugger mode.
Flow AI Pathfinder.py is a supplemental program that was used to optimize the path-finding algorithm implemented in Flow AI.py. It may be run to demonstrate how a path from A to B is found.
